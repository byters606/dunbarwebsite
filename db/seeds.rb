Walton and carried out postdoctoral research at Texas A&M University from 1985-86 under the direction of the late F. Albert Cotton. She joined the Texas A&M chemistry faculty in 1999 after being a faculty member at Michigan State University from 1987-1999 where she was served as University Distinguished Professor from 1998-1999. In 2004, she was named a Davidson Professor of Science at Texas A&M University and a joint holder of the Davidson Chair in Science, meriting particular distinction as the first female chair holder in the history of the College of Science. Kim Dunbar's research in synthetic and structural inorganic chemistry, recently funded by the National Science Foundation, Department of Energy, the American Chemical Society-Petroleum Research Fund and the Welch Foundation, is focused on the application of coordination chemistry principles to the solution of diverse problems ranging from new magnetic and conducting materials to anticancer agents. Major professional honors include an Alfred P. Sloan Foundation Fellowship, a Camille and Henry Dreyfus Teacher-Scholar Award, and Fellowships in the American Association for the Advancement of Science and the American Institute of Chemists. She received a Distinguished Alumna Award from her graduate alma mater Purdue University in 2004 and her undergraduate institution Westminster College in 2000. She serves her profession as Associate Editor of Inorganic Chemistry and is past Secretary and Chair of the American Chemical Society's Division of Inorganic Chemistry. She has mentored over 60 graduate students and postdoctoral researchers and has worked with over 30 undergraduates. She frequently hosts visiting professors and scholars from all over the world and collaborates extensively with colleagues from Europe and Asia as well as North America.

Our tutorial review in \n<i>Chemical Society Reviews</i> presents a good overview of the aims and scope of the field.<sup>1-4</sup></p><p>The main question that we are \nposing is: \"How does the interplay between anions and electron-deficient aromatic ligands mediate the structures and properties of supramolecular \narchitectures\"? An initial foray into the nature of supramolecular interactions involving anions - specifically the anion-pi interaction was \ninitiated in response to our discovery of two related metallocyclophanes, the nuclearity of which is dictated by the identity of the encapsulated \nanion.<sup>1</sup> Reactions of fully-solvated Ni<sup>II</sup> ions with the ligand 3,6-bis(2'-pyridyl)-1,2,4,5-tetrazine (bptz) yield the square \n[Ni<sub>4</sub>(bptz)<sub>4</sub>(NCCH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>8</sub>⊂BF<sub>4</sub>]<sup>7+</sup> (Figure 1, left) and pentagonal \n[Ni<sub>5</sub>(bptz)<sub>5</sub>(NCCH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>10</sub>⊂SbF<sub>6</sub>]<sup>9+</sup> (Figure 1, right) motifs in the presence of \n[BF<sub>4</sub>]<sup>-</sup> and [SbF<sub>6</sub>]<sup>-</sup> anions, respectively. Intriguingly, the pentagonal motif can be converted to \nthe square motif simply by adding the [BF<sub>4</sub>]<sup>-</sup> ions to the pentagon in solution. The reverse conversion may also be effected. \nThe previous findings along with the observation of an alignment between the central tetrazine core of bptz and [BF<sub>4</sub>]<sup>-</sup> \nin the square motif's crystal structure, suggest that anion-pi interactions are an integral part of the template effect.</p><center>\n<img width=\"282\" height=\"282\" src=\"/uploads/research_images/clip_image002.gif\" alt=\"NiSqSide.tif\">\n<img width=\"307\" height=\"282\" src=\"/uploads/research_images/clip_image003.gif\" alt=\"NiPentFront.tif\"><br clear=\"all\">\n<img width=\"271\" height=\"165\" src=\"/uploads/research_images/clip_image005.gif\" alt=\"NiSqTop.tif\">\n<img width=\"311\" height=\"165\" src=\"/uploads/research_images/clip_image006.gif\" alt=\"NiPentTop.tif\"></center>\n<p></p><p><b>Figure 1.</b> : Side (above) and top (below) views of the cationic [Ni<sub>4</sub>(bptz)<sub>4</sub>(NCCH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>8</sub>\n⊂BF<sub>4</sub>]<sup>7+</sup> (square, left) and [Ni<sub>5</sub>(bptz)<sub>5</sub>(NCCH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>10</sub>⊂SbF<sub>6</sub>]<\nsup>9+</sup> (pentagon, right) species.

Atom \ncolors: C = gray, N = blue, F = green, B = purple, Sb = yellow and Ni = tan.<sup>1</sup></p><p>The aforementioned observations led us to \nexplore the nature of anion-pi interactions in both experimental and computational systems, with a focus on the role of the electronic \nnature of the ligand and the anion identity. Our work revealed that when bptz reacts with salts of Ag<sup>I</sup>, the ensuing structure \ndepends on the identity of the anion which interacts strongly with the ligand through anion-pi interactions (the most striking example being \nthe propeller-type structure with AgSbF<sub>6</sub>).<sup>2</sup> Conversely  if a ligand with a more electron-rich central ring is used, such \nas 3,6-bis(2'-pyridyl)pyridazine (bppn), a grid structure arises regardless of the anion used, and the structure maximizes pi-pi stacking \ninteractions at the expense of anion-pi interactions (Figure 2). By using similar tricyclic ligands with varying binding motifs and electronic \ndistributions we are aim to further probe the anion-templation effect in complexes of first-row transition metals.</p><p></p>\n<center><img width=\"232\" height=\"334\" src=\"/uploads/research_images/clip_image007.gif\" alt=\"agprop.tif\">\n\t\t<img width=\"346\" height=\"334\" src=\"/uploads/research_images/clip_image008.gif\" alt=\"aggrid.tif\"><br clear=\"all\">\n\t\t<img width=\"247\" height=\"100\" src=\"/uploads/research_images/clip_image009.gif\" alt=\"bptz_esp.tif\">\n\t\t<img width=\"242\" height=\"100\" src=\"/uploads/research_images/clip_image010.gif\" alt=\"bppn_esp.tif\">\n\t\t</center><p></p>\n<p><b>Figure 2.</b> : Structures resulting from the reaction of AgSbF<sub>6</sub> with bptz (propeller, top left) and bppn (grid, top right), \nwith the electrostatic potential maps of bptz (lower left) and bppn (lower right).

Continuing research involves expanding the computational models to include multiple \nanions and multiple arenes to explore the anion-pi interaction in extended systems as well as single-point energy and geometry optimization \ncomputations on structures derived from crystallographic studies.</p><p>Perhaps even more fascinating than the role of anions in \nmetallosupramolecular chemistry is the possible role of anion-pi interactions in biological systems due to the pivotal role of anions in many \nkey chemical and biological processes.<sup>4</sup> The presence of electron-poor aromatic moieties in biomolecules such as proteins and nucleic acids led us to ask whether anion-pi interactions may play a role in protein functions, e.g., anion-transport, or other enzyme activities.  Current research in the Dunbar group aims at addressing the role of anion-π interactions in proteins and other molecules of biological interest via computational and statistical analyses of known protein structures.</p><p><b>References</b><br>\n1.\tCampos-Fernandez, C.

The reverse conversion may also be effected. \nThe previous findings along with the observation of an alignment between the central tetrazine core of bptz and [BF<sub>4</sub>]<sup>-</sup> \nin the square motif's crystal structure, suggest that anion-pi interactions are an integral part of the template effect.</p><center>\n<img width=\"282\" height=\"282\" src=\"/uploads/research_images/clip_image002.gif\" alt=\"NiSqSide.tif\">\n<img width=\"307\" height=\"282\" src=\"/uploads/research_images/clip_image003.gif\" alt=\"NiPentFront.tif\"><br clear=\"all\">\n<img width=\"271\" height=\"165\" src=\"/uploads/research_images/clip_image005.gif\" alt=\"NiSqTop.tif\">\n<img width=\"311\" height=\"165\" src=\"/uploads/research_images/clip_image006.gif\" alt=\"NiPentTop.tif\"></center>\n<p></p><p><b>Figure 1.</b> : Side (above) and top (below) views of the cationic [Ni<sub>4</sub>(bptz)<sub>4</sub>(NCCH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>8</sub>\n⊂BF<sub>4</sub>]<sup>7+</sup> (square, left) and [Ni<sub>5</sub>(bptz)<sub>5</sub>(NCCH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>10</sub>⊂SbF<sub>6</sub>]<\nsup>9+</sup> (pentagon, right) species.

Our unprecedented findings  indicate that, contrary to conventional wisdom, the equatorial \nsites in the  dirhodium complexes are favorably poised to bind DNA purine bases (e.g.,  guanine, adenine) and DNA fragments (e.g., d(GpG), d(pGpG), \nd(ApA), d(GpA),  d(ApG));<sup>3-6</sup> these interactions lead to the formation of rare  nucleobase tautomers implicated in DNA mutations. \nSuperposition  of the low energy Rh<sub>2</sub>(O2CCH3)<sub>2</sub>{d(pGpG)}  conformer, generated by from  2D NMR data and simulated annealing  \ncalculations, with the crystal structure of <i>cis</i>-[Pt(NH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>{d(pGpG)}],  reveals remarkable similarities between the \nadducts; the two octahedral rhodium  atoms are capable of engaging in <i>cis</i> binding to GG intrastrand sites by establishing <i>N7/O6</i> \nbridges that span the Rh–Rh bond (Figure 2).<sup>4</sup>&nbsp; Furthermore, detailed 2D NMR data  analyses performed on the double-stranded DNA \n12mer d(CTCTC5<sup>*</sup>A6<sup>*</sup>ACTTCC)·d(GGAAGTTGAGAG) revealed that the  duplex forms an <i>intrastrand</i> adduct  with the dirhodium \nunit binding to residues C5 and A6 (Figure 3), which  significantly destabilizes the duplex.7 Coordinative binding, to the  dirhodium unit, of \nA6 takes place via N7 whereas binding of the C5 base takes  place via the exocyclic N4 site resulting in the <i>anti</i> cytosine rotamer in its \nmetal-stabilized rare iminooxo form.<sup>7</sup>  Formation and stabilization of rare base forms and mispairs can be one of the  factors that \ncontribute to the antitumor activity of dirhodium compounds.</p>\n<p></p><center><img width=\"426\" height=\"201\" src=\"/uploads/research_images/clip_image002.jpg\"></center><br clear=\"all\"><p></p>\n<p><strong>Figure 1. </strong>Structures  of (A)<strong> </strong>Rh<sub>2</sub>(O<sub>2</sub>CR)<sub>4</sub>L<sub>2</sub>  and (B) \n[Rh<sub>2</sub>(O<sub>2</sub>CCH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>(N-N)<sub>2</sub>L<sub>2</sub>]<sup>2+</sup>.</p>\n<p></p><center><img width=\"252\" height=\"252\" src=\"/uploads/research_images/clip_image004.jpg\"></center><br clear=\"all\"><p></p>\n<p><strong>Figure 2. </strong>Superposition of low energy  Rh<sub>2</sub>(O<sub>2</sub>CCH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>{d(pGpG)} conformer  \n(colored model), generated from 2D NMR data and simulated annealing  calculations, with the crystallographically determined <i>cis</i>-\n[Pt(NH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>{d(pGpG)}] (light blue).</p>\n<p></p><center><img width=\"360\" height=\"270\" src=\"/uploads/research_images/clip_image006.jpg\"></center><br clear=\"all\"><p></p>\n<p><strong>Figure  3.</strong> Model of the DNA  duplex d(CTCTC<sup>*</sup>A<sup>*</sup>ACTTCC)·d(GGAAGTTGAGAG) cross-linked by \nthe dirhodium unit<i> cis</i>-[Rh2(<i>m</i>-O2CCH3)2(<i>h</i><sup>1</sup>-O2CCH3)]<sup>+</sup>at the cytosine-adenine  step; DNA base \ncolors: A: pink; C: light blue;  G: green; T: yellow.
